# ApexCharts Card by [@RomRider](https://github.com/RomRider) <!-- omit in toc -->

![Header](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card/raw/master/docs/Header.png)

This is higly customizable graph card for [Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)'s Lovelace UI.<br/>

It is based on [ApexCharts.js](https://apexcharts.com) and offers most of the features of the library.

It is also inspired by the great [`mini-graph-card`](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card) by [@kalkih](https://github.com/kalkih)


However, some things might be broken :grin:

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

This card is available in [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store).
<small>_HACS is a third party community store and is not included in Home Assistant out of the box._</small>

### Manual install

1. Download and copy `apexcharts-card.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card/releases/latest) into your `config/www` directory.

2. Add the resource reference as decribed below.

### CLI install

1. Move into your `config/www` directory.

2. Grab `apexcharts-card.js`:

```
$Â wget https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card/releases/download/v1.6.0/apexcharts-card.js
```

3. Add the resource reference as decribed below.

### Add resource reference

If you configure Lovelace via YAML, add a reference to `apexcharts-card.js` inside your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml

## Using the card

### Main Options

:warning: Since this card is in its debuts, you should expect breaking changes moving forward. :warning:

The card stricly validates all the options available (but not for the `apex_config` object). If there is an error in your configuration, it will tell you where and display a red error card.


:white_check_mark: **means required**.

| Name | Type | Default | Since | Description |
| ---- | :--: | :-----: | :---: | ----------- |
| :white_check_mark: `type` | string | | v1.0.0 | `custom:apexcharts-card` |
| :white_check_mark: `series` | array | | v1.0.0 | See [series](#series-options) |
| `config_templates` | array | | v1.6.0 | Define a configuration once and reuse it multiple times. See [config_templates](#configuration-templates) |
| `color_list` | array | | v1.6.0 | Define the array of colors applied to the series. Will be overriden by each serie's color if defined. Usefull for `config_templates` mainly. |
| `all_series_config` | object | | v1.6.0 | If something is defined here it will apply this config to all the series. It accepts the same options as a serie minus `entity`. It is useful to avoid repetition but the same thing can be achieve in each serie individually. See [series](#series-options) and [all_series_config](#all_series_config-options) for an example |
| `chart_type` | string | `line` | v1.4.0 | See [chart_type](#chart_type-options) |
| `update_interval` | string | | v1.1.0 | By default the card updates on every state change. Setting this overrides the behaviour. Valid values are any time string, eg: `1h`, `12min`, `1d`, `1h25`, `10sec`, ... |
| `update_delay` | string | `1500ms` | v1.4.0 | If the chart doesn't display the last state but the one before, you'll want to increase this value, don't go over `10s`, it's not necessary. You'll also want to increase this value if you are using `attribute` in the `series`. Valid values are any time strings. This is because of how Home-Assistant works with history, see [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/#commit_interval) |
| `graph_span` | string | `24h` | v1.1.0 | The span of the graph as a time interval. Valid values are any time string, eg: `1h`, `12min`, `1d`, `1h25`, `10sec`, ... |
| `span` | object | | v1.2.0 | See [span](#span-options) |
| `show` | object | | v1.0.0 | See [show](#main-show-options) |
| ~~`hours_12`~~ | ~~boolean~~ | ~~`false`~~ | ~~v1.5.0~~ | **Deprecated since NEXT_VERSION** ~~Display time in 12h format instead of the default 24h format~~ |
| `cache` | boolean | `true` | v1.0.0 | Use in-browser data caching to reduce the load on Home Assistant's server |
| `stacked` | boolean | `false` | v1.0.0 | Enable if you want the data to be stacked on the graph |
| `layout` | string | | v1.0.0 | See [layouts](#layouts) |
| `header` | object | | v1.0.0 | See [header](#header-options) |
| `now` | object | | v1.5.0 | See [now](#now-options) |
| `y_axis_precision` | numnber | `1` | v1.2.0 | The float precision used to display numbers on the Y axis |
| `apex_config`| object | | v1.0.0 | Apexcharts API 1:1 mapping. You call see all the options [here](https://apexcharts.com/docs/installation/) --> `Options (Reference)` in the Menu. See [Apex Charts](#apex-charts-options-example) |
| `experimental` | object | | v1.6.0 | See [experimental](#experimental-features) |
| `locale` | string | | NEXT_VERSION | Default is to inherit from Home-Assistant's user configuration. This overrides it and forces the locale. Eg: `en`, or `fr`. Reverts to `en` if locale is unknown. |



### `series` Options

| Name | Type | Default | Since | Description |
| ---- | :--: | :-----: | :---: | ----------- |
| :white_check_mark: `entity` | string | | v1.0.0 | The `entity_id` of the sensor to display |
| `attribute` | string | | v1.4.0 | Instead of retrieving the state, it will retrieve an `attribute` of the entity. Make sure you increase `update_delay` if the chart doesn't reflect the last value of the attribute |
| `name` | string | | v1.0.0 | Override the name of the entity |
| `color` | string | | v1.1.0 | Color of the serie. Supported formats: `yellow`, `#aabbcc`, `rgb(128, 128, 128)` or `var(--css-color-variable)` |

| `extend_to_end` | boolean | `true` | v1.0.0 | If the last data is older than the end time displayed on the graph, setting to true will extend the value until the end of the timeline. Only works for `line` and `area` types. |
| `unit` | string | | v1.0.0 | Override the unit of the sensor |
| `float_precision` | number | `1` | v1.2.0 | The precision used to display data in the legend and the tooltip. It doesn't impact how the data is displayed on the graph |
| `fill_raw` | string | `'null'` | v1.5.0 | If there is any missing value in the history, `last` will replace them with the last non-empty state, `zero` will fill missing values with `0`, `'null'` will fill missing values with `null`. This is applied before `group_by` options |
| `group_by` | object | | v1.0.0 | See [group_by](#group_by-options) |
| `invert` | boolean | `false` | v1.2.0 | Negates the data (`1` -> `-1`). Usefull to display opposites values like network in (standard)/out (inverted) |
| `transform` | string | | v1.5.0 | Transform your raw data in any way you like. See [transform](#transform-option) |
| `data_generator` | string | | v1.2.0 | See [data_generator](#data_generator-option) |
| `offset` | string | | v1.3.0 | This is different from the main `offset` parameter. This is at the series level. It is only usefull if you want to display data from for eg. yesterday on top of the data from today for the same sensor and compare the data. The time displayed in the tooltip will be wrong as will the x axis information. Valid values are any negative time string, eg: `-1h`, `-12min`, `-1d`, `-1h25`, `-10sec`, ... |
| `min` | number | `0` | v1.4.0 | Only used when `chart_type = radialBar`, see [chart_type](#chart_type-options). Used to convert the value into a percentage. Minimum value of the sensor |
| `max` | number | `100` | v1.4.0 | Only used when `chart_type = radialBar`, see [chart_type](#chart_type-options). Used to convert the value into a percentage. Maximum value of the sensor |

| `as_duration` | string | | v1.3.0 | Will pretty print the states as durations. Doesn't affect the graph, only the tooltip/legend/header display. You provide the source unit of your sensor. Valid values are `millisecond`, `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`.<br/>Eg: if the state is `345` and `as_duration` is set to `minute` then it would display `5h 45m` |
| `in_header` | boolean or string | `true` | v1.4.0 | If `show_states` is enabled, this would show/hide this specific serie in the header. If set to `raw` (introduced in NEXT_VERSION), it would display the latest raw state of the entity in the header bypassing any grouping/transformation done by the card. |
| `in_chart` | boolean | `true` | v1.4.0 | If `false`, hides the serie from the chart |
| `datalabels` | boolean or string | `false` | v1.5.0 | If `true` will show the value of each point for this serie directly in the chart. Don't use it if you have a lot of points displayed, it will be a mess. If you set it to `total` (introduced in NEXT_VERSION), it will display the stacked total value (only works when `stacked: true`) |
| `hidden_by_default` | boolean | `false` | v1.6.0 | See [experimental](#hidden_by_default-experimental-feature) |
| `extremas` | boolean | `false` | NEXT_VERSION | If enabled, will show the min and the max of the serie in the chart |

| `func` | string | `raw` | v1.0.0 | See [func](#func-options) |
| `duration` | string | `1h` | v1.0.0 | If `func` is **not** `raw` only. It builds buckets of states over `duration` period of time. Doesn't work for months. Eg of valid values: `2h`, `1d`, `10s`, `25min`, `1h30`, ... |
| `fill` | string | `last` | v1.0.0 | If `func` is **not** `raw` only. If there is any missing value in the buckets of history data (grouped by duration), `last` will replace them with the last non-empty state, `zero` will fill missing values with `0`, `'null'` will fill missing values with `null` |

### `func` Options

| Name | Since | Description |
| ---- | :---: | ----------- |
| `raw` | v1.0.0 | Displays all the state history as known by Home Assistant |
| `avg` | v1.0.0 | Will return the average of all the states in each bucket |
| `min` | v1.0.0 | Will return the smallest state of each bucket |
| `max` | v1.0.0 | Will return the biggest state of each bucket |

| `pie` | v1.4.0 | This will display a pie chart with the last value computed of each sensor |
| `donut` | v1.4.0 | This will display a donut chart with the last value computed of each sensor, same as pie but with a hole in the center |
| `radialBar` | v1.4.0 | This will display a radial bar chart with the last value computed of each sensor. The value is represented in percentage only. It is required to provide `min` and `max` for each series displayed as it requires to convert the value into percentage. The default value for `min` is `0` and for `max` it is `100`. This graph works well if you want to display sensors natively in percentages |

![Charts Type](docs/charts_type.png)

### `span` Options

| Name | Since | Description |
| ---- | :---: | ----------- |
| `start` | v1.2.0 | Display the graph from the begining of the `minute`, `day`, `hour`, `week`, `month`, `year` |
| `end` | v1.2.0 | Display the graph from the end of the `minute`, `day`, `hour`, `week`, `month`, `year` |
| `offset` | v1.2.0 | Offset the graph by an amount of time. To offset in the past, start with `-`. Eg. of valid values: `-1day`, `-12h`, `12h`, `30min`, ... |

Span enables you to:
* Offset the graph by an amount of time
* `start`: Display the graph from the begining of the `minute`, `day`, `hour`, `week`, `month`, `year`. In this case, `graph_span` should be in most cases `<=` to 1 unit of the unit defined in start.
* `end`: Display the graph from the end of the `minute`, `day`, `hour`, `week`, `month`, `year`
* Combined with `group_by` in a serie, the group will begin at the tick of the `start` unit (+/- `offset` if defined)
* Only one of `start` or `end` is supported at the same time

```yaml
graph_span: If start is defined, it should be <= to 1 unit of the one defined in `start`
span:
  start: minute, day, hour, week, month or year
  end: minute, day, hour, week, month or year
  offset: To offset in the past, prefix with `-` Timerange like 1day, 12h, 10min, -12h, -1d, ...
```

Eg:
* Display 24h from the start of the current day (00:00 -> 23:59)
  ```yaml
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
  graph_span: 24h
  span:
    start: day
  ```
* Display 24h from the start of the previous day (00:00 -> 23:59, -1 day)
  ```yaml
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
  graph_span: 24h
  span:
    start: day
    offset: -1d
  ```
* Display 12h between 06:00 and 18:00 of the current day
  ```yaml
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
  graph_span: 12h
  span:
    start: day
    offset: +6h
  ```
* Display the last 7 days, the end of the graph is the end of the current day
  ```yaml
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
  graph_span: 7d
  span:
    end: day
  ```

### `transform` Option

With transform, you can modify raw data comming from Home-Assistant's history using a javascript function.

Some of the things you can do:
* Transform any state into a number (for eg. for binary_sensors)
* Apply a different scale to your data (eg: divide by 1024 to convert bits into Kbits)
* Do anything that javascript allows with the value

Your javascript code will receive:
* `x`: a state or a value of the attribute if you defined one (it can be a `string`, `null` or a `number` depending on the entity type you've assigned)
* `hass`: the full `hass` object (`hass.states['other.entity']` to get the state object of another entity for eg.)
* `entity`: the full state object of the entity from the history entry currently being transformed

And should return a `number`, a `float` or `null`.

Some examples:
* Convert `binary_sensor` to numbers (`1` is `on`, `0` is `off`)
  ```yaml
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
  update_delay: 3s
  update_interval: 1min
  series:
    - entity: binary_sensor.heating
      transform: "return x === 'on' ? 1 : 0;"
  ```

* Scale a sensor:
  ```yaml
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
  update_delay: 3s
  update_interval: 1min
  series:
    - entity: sensor.bandwidth
      transform: "return x / 1024;"
  ```

### `data_generator` Option

Before we start, to learn javascript, google is your friend or ask for help on the [forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/apexcharts-card-a-highly-customizable-graph-card/272877) :slightly_smiling_face:

`data_generator` is an advanced feature. It enables you to build your own data out of the last state of a sensor. It completely bypasses the history retrieval and caching mecanism.

You'll need to write a javascript function which returns a `[timestamp, value][]`:
* `timestamp` is the timestamp of the data in ms
* `value` is the value of the data as a number or a float, make sure you parse it if it's a string.

Inside your javascript code, you'll have access to those variables:
* `entity`: the entity object
* `start` (Date object): the start Date object of the graph currently displayed
* `end` (Date object): the end Date object of the graph currently displayed
* `hass`: the complete `hass` object
* `moment`: the [Moment.JS](https://momentjs.com/) object to help you manipulate time and dates

Let's take this example:
* My sensor (`sensor.test`) has this state as its last state:
  ```yaml
  FirstPeak: High
  PeakTimes:
    - '2021-01-27 03:43:00'
    - '2021-01-27 10:24:00'
    - '2021-01-27 16:02:00'
    - '2021-01-27 22:38:00'
    - '2021-01-28 04:21:00'
    - '2021-01-28 11:06:00'
    - '2021-01-28 16:40:00'
    - '2021-01-28 23:18:00'
    - '2021-01-29 05:00:00'
    - '2021-01-29 11:45:00'
    - '2021-01-29 17:19:00'
    - '2021-01-29 23:58:00'
    - '2021-01-30 05:39:00'
    - '2021-01-30 12:25:00'
    - '2021-01-30 17:59:00'
  PeakHeights:
    - 4.99
    - 1.41
    - 4.96
    - 1.33
    - 5.22
    - 1.19
    - 5.15
    - 1.14
    - 5.42
    - 1.01
    - 5.3
    - 0.99
    - 5.57
    - 0.87
    - 5.39
  unit_of_measurement: m
  friendly_name: Tides
  ```
* This is data in the future, but I want to display them so I need to build them myself using `data_generator`:
  ```yaml
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
  graph_span: 4d # I have 4 days worth of data in the future in the attributes
  span:
    start: hour # I want to display from the start of the current hours 4 days into the future
  series:
    - entity: sensor.test
      data_generator: | # This is what builds the data
        return entity.attributes.PeakTimes.map((peak, index) => {
          return [new Date(peak).getTime(), entity.attributes.PeakHeights[index]];
        });
  ```
  The result of this function call would be something like: <br/>
  `[[1611718980000, 4.99], [1611743040000, 1.41], [1611763320000, 4.96], ...]`

* And this is all you need :tada:

### Apex Charts Options Example

This is how you could change some options from ApexCharts as described on the [`Options (Reference)` menu entry](https://apexcharts.com/docs/installation/).

Hundreds of options are available and it is not possible to describe them all here so check over there and ask on the [forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/apexcharts-card-a-highly-customizable-graph-card/272877) if you need help with using them.

* :warning: Some options might not work in the context of this card.
* :warning: Everything which is available through the default config of this card shouldn't be defined in `apex_config`. If you do, it might break.

```yaml
type: custom:apexcharts-card
series:
  - ...
apex_config:
  dataLabels:
    enabled: true
    dropShadow:
      enabled: true
```

### Layouts

For now, only `minimal` is supported: It will remove the grid, the axis and display the legend at the top. But you can use the `apex_config` to do whatever you want.

* `minimal`

  ![minimal](docs/minimal.png)

For code junkies, you'll find the default options I use in [`src/apex-layouts.ts`](src/apex-layouts.ts)

### Configuration Templates

- Define your config template in the main lovelace configuration and then use it in your cards. This will avoid a lot of repetitions! It's basically YAML anchors, but without using YAML anchors and is very useful if you split your config in multiple files ð
- You can overload any parameter with a new one
- Arrays will be merged by matching the index
- You can also inherit another template from within a template.
- You can inherit multiple templates at once by making it an array. In this case, the templates will be merged together with the current configuration in the order they are defined. This happens recursively.

  ```yaml
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
  config_templates:
    - template1
    - template2
  # or
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
  config_templates: template1
  ```

The card templates will be applied in the order they are defined: `template2` will be merged with `template1` and then the local config will be merged with the result. You can still chain templates together (ie. define template in a apexcharts-card template. It will follow the path recursively).

Make sure which type of lovelace dashboard you are using before changing the main lovelace configuration:
  * **`managed`** changes are managed by lovelace UI - add the template configuration to configuration in raw editor
      * go to your dashboard
      * click three dots and `Edit dashboard` button
      * click three dots again and click `Raw configuration editor` button
  * **`yaml`** - add template configuration to your dashboard file (`ui-lovelace.yaml` for eg.)

**Note:** Templates have to be defined in all dashboards, they are not shared.

To give you an idea where to put those (in your dashboard file/RAW editor):
```yaml
apexcharts_card_templates:
  default:
    color_list: ['red', 'green', 'blue']

  bandwidth_chart:
    graph_span: 24h
    config_templates: default
    header:
      show: true
      show_states: true
      colorize_states: true
    all_series_config:
      stroke_width: 2
      opacity: 0.3
      type: area

views:
  - title: Main
    panel: true
    cards:
      [...]
```

And then where you define your card, you can consume those templates, and/or overload it:

```yaml
- type: custom:apexcharts-card
  config_templates: bandwidth_chart
  header:
    title: WAN Bandwidth
  series:
    - entity: sensor.wan_download
    - entity: sensor.wan_upload
      invert: true
```

In the end, this would produce the same result as but it's shorter and you can reuse that template elsewhere:
```yaml
- type: custom:apexcharts-card
  graph_span: 24h
  header:
    title: WAN Bandwidth
    show: true
    show_states: true
    colorize_states: true
  all_series_config:
    stroke_width: 2
    opacity: 0.3
    type: area
  color_list: ['red', 'green', 'blue']
  series:
    - entity: sensor.wan_download
    - entity: sensor.wan_upload
      invert: true
```

#### `all_series_config` options

This will allow you to apply some settings to all the series avoiding repetition. It's just syntaxic sugar and doesn't add more features.

Eg:
```yaml
- type: custom:apexcharts-card
  graph_span: 24h
  all_series_config:
    stroke_width: 2
    type: area
    transform: return x / 1024;
    unit: Mb/s
  series:
    - entity: sensor.wan_download
    - entity: sensor.wan_upload
      invert: true
```

Generates the same result as repeating the configuration in each series:
```yaml
- type: custom:apexcharts-card
  graph_span: 24h
  series:
    - entity: sensor.wan_download
      stroke_width: 2
      type: area
      transform: return x / 1024;
      unit: Mb/s
    - entity: sensor.wan_upload
      invert: true
      stroke_width: 2
      type: area
      transform: return x / 1024;
      unit: Mb/s
```

## Experimental features

:warning: You enter the danger zone :warning:

### Configuration options

| Name | Type | Default | Since | Description |
| ---- | :--: | :-----: | :---: | ----------- |
| `color_threshold` | boolean | `false` | v1.6.0 | Will enable the color threshold feature. See [color_threshold](#color_threshold-experimental-feature) |
| `disable_config_validation` | boolean | `false` | v1.6.0 | If `true`, will disable the config validation. Useful if you have cards adding parameters to this one. Use at your own risk. |
| `hidden_by_default` | boolean | `false` | v1.6.0 | Will allow you to use the `hidden_by_default` option. See [hidden_by_default](#hidden_by_default-experimental-feature) |

### `color_threshold` experimental feature

`color_threshold` is an experimental feature for now since enabling it will break some other default features.

If enabled, it might:
* display the wrong serie color in the tooltip in some cases (series with datapoints not aligned mostly)
* display thin columns instead of the standard size
* completely render `apex_config.fill` options unusable, and if you do, it will break the card

Now that you are warned, it works with:
* `chart_type`: `radialBar`, `line`, `pie`, `donut`
* `series`'s `type`: `column`, `area`, `line`

Some notes:
* For `series`'s `type: column`, the full bar will be of the color defined. Gradient is not possible
* For `series`'s `type: area`:
  * only the filled area will be displayed with the gradient. It is not possible to do so for the line.
  * It works better with `stroke_width: 1` or `stroke_width: 0`
* If using `invert: true`, the values in `color_threshold` should stay the same as with `invert: false`.


And this is how to use it:
```yaml
type: custom:apexcharts-card
experimental:
  color_threshold: true
series:
  - entity: sensor.temperature
    color_threshold:
      - value: -10
        # color can be a color name, rgb(r, g, b), '#0000ff' or var(--color-variable)
        # default is: the default color of the serie
        color: blue
        # optional opacity, value from 0 to 1.
        # only for line and area
        # Default is 1 for 'type: line' and 0.7 for `type: area`
        opacity: 1
      - value: 0
        color: cyan
      - value: 15
        color: green
      - value: 25
        color: orange
```

### `hidden_by_default` experimental feature

Enabling this experimental feature might/will break the auto-scaling and auto-column width feature. Don't open an issue for that. It only works if all the series have a unique name.

This option is useful if you want to hide a serie from the chart by default when it's loaded as if you had clicked on the legend to disable this serie.

This is how to use it:
```yaml
type: custom:apexcharts-card
experimental:
  hidden_by_default: true
series:
  - entity: sensor.temperature
    show:
      hidden_by_default: true
  - entity: sensor.temperature_office
```

## Known issues

* Sometimes, if `smoothing` is used alongside `area` and there is missing data in the chart, the background will be glitchy. See [apexcharts.js/#2180](https://github.com/apexcharts/apexcharts.js/issues/2180)
* `binary_sensor` is not yet supported.
* Bars will span left and right of the data point. Not so great if you use `func` to aggregate your data. See [apexcharts.js/#1688](https://github.com/apexcharts/apexcharts.js/issues/1688)

## Roadmap

Not ordered by priority:

* [X] ~~Support more types of charts (pie, radial, polar area at least)~~
* [X] ~~Support for `binary_sensors`~~
* [X] ~~Support for aggregating data with exact boundaries (ex: aggregating data with `1h` could aggregate from `2:00:00am` to `2:59:59am` then `3:00:00am` to `3:59:59` exactly, etc...)~~
* [X] ~~Display the graph from start of day, week, month, ... with support for "up to now" or until the "end of the period"~~
* [ ] Support for any number of Y-axis
* [ ] Support for logarithmic
* [X] ~~Support for state mapping for non-numerical state sensors~~
* [X] ~~Support for simple color threshold (easier to understand/write than the ones provided natively by ApexCharts)~~
* [X] ~~Support for graph configuration templates Ã  la [`button-card`](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card/blob/master/README.md#configuration-templates)~~

```

### Change the line thickness

* Change all lines thickness

  ```yaml
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
  graph_span: 1d

  series:
    - entity: sensor.temperature
      stroke_width: 2
    - entity: sensor.humidity
      stroke_width: 6
  ```

### Use apexcharts-card with auto-entities

This requires the [auto-entities card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities)

```yaml
type: custom:auto-entities
filter:
  include:
    - entity_id: sensor.temperature*
      options:
        entity: this.entity_id
card:
  type: custom:apexcharts-card
```

### Change the height of the graph

This is described in the ApexCharts.js documentation [here](https://apexcharts.com/docs/options/chart/height/) where you can find way more options.

```yaml
type: custom:apexchart-card
apex_config:
  chart:
    height: 250px
series:
  - entity: sensor.temperature
```
